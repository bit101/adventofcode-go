# adventofcode-go
All my advent of code submissions.

Well, all my current attempts. I did some previous years but got at most 12 stars. Starting fresh in 2022, but also working my way though 2020.

Wondering if I can actually finish this year. In my experience, the toughness ramps up after the first week.
